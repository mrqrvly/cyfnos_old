Cyfnos
======

Cyfnos is a phase-based game in which the player fights an oncoming horde of enemies in the area of Cyfnos Village, where a strange affliction has tainted the people and creatures.

The game can be broken down into three phases: preparation for battle, creature attack phase, and player attack phase. The goal is to slay as many creatures as possible before the player is killed.

Problems:
I did not expect some things to take as much time or to be as complex as was actually the case; therefore, the scope of the project was much too large in the beginng. I was able to effectively identify the components that could be removed while retaining core functionality, but I was still left in a little bit of a time crunch at the end. The complexity also left some of the function triggers out of place and, while, the game still functions 98% correctly, it does still need some tweaking.



Features to be added later:
- The player is given a choice in the preparation phase to defend or attack; if they defend, the do not get an attack phase, but their defense is considerably higher and they get a boost to counter chance and counter strength
- Upon acquiring new items, the player has a choice to get rid of something in their item belt in favor of the new item; as it stands, the new item generation will not even trigger if the item belt is full.
- I want to add my own custom pixel graphics
- The player will occasionally encounter a merchant instead of an enemy; they can buy items, weapons, or sheilds from this merchant; this would of course require the implementation of some sort of currency or point system.
- The player can equip different weapons during the preparation phase, and so use a different weapon each turn if they like.
